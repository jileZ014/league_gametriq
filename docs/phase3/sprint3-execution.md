  checkInterval: 30, // minutes
  cancellationThreshold: 110,
  warnings: {
    yellow: 100, // Hydration reminders
    orange: 105, // Consider rescheduling
    red: 110    // Mandatory cancellation
  }
}

## 🚀 Demo Preparation (60% Ready)

### Scenario 1: Schedule Generation ✅
- Season creation complete
- Division setup working
- Venue configuration done
- Schedule generation functional
- Conflict resolution demonstrated

### Scenario 2: Game Day Operations 🔄
- Pre-game check-in (80%)
- Live scoring (70%)
- Period management (60%)
- Final score (50%)
- Standings update (40%)

### Scenario 3: Notifications 🔄
- Schedule published emails working
- Game reminders configured
- Push notifications wired (iOS pending)

## 📋 Remaining Critical Tasks

### Must Complete (Days 7-9)
1. Finish WebSocket live scoring
2. Complete standings calculation
3. Implement game finalization
4. Wire up all notifications
5. Complete calendar drag-drop
6. Mobile check-in flow
7. E2E test completion
8. Load testing execution

### Nice to Have
- Advanced conflict resolution UI
- Referee availability management
- Tournament bracket support

## 🔴 Risk Items

1. **WebSocket scalability under load** - Mitigation: Redis pub/sub tested and working
2. **Standing calculation accuracy** - Mitigation: Unit tests comprehensive
3. **iOS push notifications** - Mitigation: Android working, iOS cert in progress
