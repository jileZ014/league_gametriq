### Testing Environment Setup
**URL**: https://sit.legacyyouthsports.com  
**Database**: SIT environment with production-like data  
**Configuration**: Production configuration with test payment processing  

### Integration Test Scenarios

#### 1. Tournament End-to-End Flow
```gherkin
Scenario: Complete tournament lifecycle
  Given a league administrator creates a new tournament
  When teams register and pay entry fees
  And the tournament bracket is generated
  And matches are played with live score updates
  Then winners advance automatically
  And final reports are generated
  And payments are processed correctly
```

#### 2. Real-time System Integration
```gherkin
Scenario: Multi-user real-time updates
  Given 50+ users viewing a live tournament bracket
  When a scorekeeper updates match scores
  Then all users see bracket updates within 2 seconds
  And standings are updated automatically
  And notifications are sent to advanced teams
```

#### 3. Payment System Integration
```gherkin
Scenario: Payment processing during high load
  Given 100+ teams registering simultaneously
  When payment processing is initiated
  Then all payments are processed successfully
  And duplicate charges are prevented
  And refunds work correctly for cancelled registrations
```

#### 4. Mobile App Integration
```gherkin
Scenario: Mobile app offline/online sync
  Given a coach uses the mobile app offline
  When roster changes are made without internet
  And internet connection is restored
  Then all changes sync successfully
  And no data is lost
```

#### 5. Report Generation Integration
```gherkin
Scenario: Automated report delivery
  Given scheduled reports are configured
  When the scheduled time arrives
  Then reports generate successfully
  And emails are delivered to recipients
  And PDF quality meets standards
```
