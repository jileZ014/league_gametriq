### Integration Resilience and Error Handling

#### Circuit Breaker and Failover Patterns
```typescript
// Integration Resilience Implementation
class IntegrationResilienceManager {
  private circuitBreakers: Map<string, CircuitBreaker> = new Map();
  
  constructor() {
    this.initializeCircuitBreakers();
  }
  
  private initializeCircuitBreakers(): void {
    // Payment Processing Circuit Breaker
    this.circuitBreakers.set('stripe', new CircuitBreaker({
      failureThreshold: 5,
      recoveryTimeout: 60000, // 1 minute
      monitoringPeriod: 300000, // 5 minutes
      fallbackStrategy: 'queue_for_retry'
    }));
    
    // Email Service Circuit Breaker
    this.circuitBreakers.set('email', new CircuitBreaker({
      failureThreshold: 10,
      recoveryTimeout: 30000, // 30 seconds
      monitoringPeriod: 180000, // 3 minutes
      fallbackStrategy: 'secondary_provider'
    }));
    
    // Weather Service Circuit Breaker
    this.circuitBreakers.set('weather', new CircuitBreaker({
      failureThreshold: 3,
      recoveryTimeout: 120000, // 2 minutes
      monitoringPeriod: 300000, // 5 minutes
      fallbackStrategy: 'cached_data'
    }));
  }
  
  async callExternalService<T>(
    serviceName: string,
    operation: () => Promise<T>
  ): Promise<T> {
    const circuitBreaker = this.circuitBreakers.get(serviceName);
    
    if (!circuitBreaker) {
      throw new Error(`No circuit breaker configured for service: ${serviceName}`);
    }
    
    return await circuitBreaker.execute(operation);
  }
  
  // Webhook processing with idempotency and retry logic
  async processWebhook(
    service: string,
    webhookData: any,
    idempotencyKey: string
  ): Promise<void> {
    // Check for duplicate processing
    if (await this.isDuplicateWebhook(idempotencyKey)) {
      console.log(`Duplicate webhook ignored: ${idempotencyKey}`);
      return;
    }
    
    try {
      // Process webhook with service-specific handler
      await this.handleWebhookByService(service, webhookData);
      
      // Mark as successfully processed
      await this.markWebhookProcessed(idempotencyKey);
      
    } catch (error) {
      // Log error and schedule retry
      console.error(`Webhook processing failed: ${error.message}`);
      await this.scheduleWebhookRetry(idempotencyKey, webhookData);
      throw error;
    }
  }
}
```
