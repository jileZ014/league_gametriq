# Phase 3: Comprehensive Observability and Monitoring Strategy
## Basketball League Management Platform

**Document ID:** OBS-STRATEGY-001  
**Version:** 1.0  
**Date:** August 8, 2025  
**Author:** Data Analyst Agent  
**Status:** Phase 3 Observability Implementation  

---

## Executive Summary

This document defines the comprehensive observability and monitoring strategy for the Basketball League Management Platform Phase 3, implementing the three pillars of observability (metrics, traces, and logs) with basketball-specific KPIs, youth safety monitoring, and COPPA compliance tracking.

### Key Observability Principles
- **Golden Signals**: Latency, Traffic, Errors, Saturation monitoring
- **Business KPIs**: Basketball-specific metrics for stakeholder visibility
- **Youth Safety**: Specialized monitoring for COPPA compliance and SafeSport requirements
- **Real-time Performance**: Sub-100ms latency tracking for live game features
- **Multi-tenant Isolation**: Performance monitoring across league boundaries
- **Phoenix-Specific**: Heat safety and weather monitoring for Arizona operations

      const result = await this.chargePayment(paymentData);
      
      this.telemetry.recordPaymentTransaction(
        result.status === 'succeeded' ? 'success' : 'failed',
        {
          paymentType: paymentData.type,
          amount: paymentData.amount,

      this.telemetry.recordCoppaEvent('data_access', {
        dataType,
        userType: requesterType,
        accessType,
        parentalConsent: user.parentalConsentStatus,
      });
    }
    
    // Proceed with data access
    return this.performDataAccess(userId, dataType, accessType);
  }
}
```

#### Safety Incident Tracking
```typescript
// Safety incident reporting
export class SafetyService {
  async reportIncident(incident: SafetyIncident) {
    // Immediate telemetry recording
    this.telemetry.recordSafetyIncident(incident.type, {
      severity: incident.severity,
      leagueId: incident.leagueId,
      location: incident.location,
      description: incident.description,
    });
    
    // Trigger immediate notifications
    if (incident.severity === 'critical' || incident.severity === 'high') {
      await this.notificationService.sendEmergencyAlert(incident);
    }
    
    // Store incident in database
    return this.storeIncident(incident);
  }
}
```

### 8.4 Phase 4: Phoenix-Specific Features (Week 7-8)

#### Weather Monitoring Integration
```typescript
// Heat safety monitoring
export class WeatherService {
  async checkHeatConditions(location: string) {
    const weather = await this.weatherAPI.getCurrentConditions(location);
    const heatIndex = this.calculateHeatIndex(weather.temperature, weather.humidity);
    
    // Record heat index metric
    this.telemetry.recordWeatherAlert('heat_advisory', {
      severity: this.getHeatSeverity(heatIndex),
      location,
      temperature: weather.temperature,
      heatIndex,
      venue: weather.venue,
    });
    
    // Check for game cancellation thresholds
    if (heatIndex > 130) {
      await this.gameService.evaluateGameCancellations(location, heatIndex);
    }
    
    return { heatIndex, severity: this.getHeatSeverity(heatIndex) };
  }
}
```
