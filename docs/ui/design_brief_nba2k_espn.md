## Visual Language

### Color Philosophy

**Dark-First Approach:**
- Primary backgrounds are deep, rich darks
- Content "glows" against dark canvas
- Team colors as accent highlights
- Semantic colors for quick scanning

**Dynamic Theming:**
- Team colors automatically extracted
- Complementary palettes generated
- Consistent contrast ratios maintained
- Special modes for tournaments/playoffs

### Typography Strategy

**Display Typography:**
- Bold, condensed for maximum impact
- Variable fonts for weight flexibility
- Tabular numbers for statistics
- Custom ligatures for common terms

**Hierarchy Levels:**
1. **Hero** (72px+) - Scores, critical numbers
2. **Display** (48px) - Team names, section heads
3. **Title** (32px) - Subsection headers
4. **Body** (16px) - Primary content
5. **Caption** (14px) - Secondary information
6. **Micro** (12px) - Metadata, labels

### Spatial System

**Grid Foundation:**
- 4px base unit for consistency
- 12-column grid on desktop
- 4-column grid on mobile
- Consistent gutters and margins

**Elevation Strategy:**
- 5 distinct elevation levels
- Shadows indicate interactivity
- Glows for active/live elements
- Depth creates focus hierarchy

## Motion Philosophy

### Purpose-Driven Animation

**Entrance (200-400ms):**
- SlideIn for new content
- FadeIn for supporting elements
- ScaleUp for celebrations
- Stagger for lists

**State Changes (100-300ms):**
- Smooth color transitions
- Number countUp for scores
- Progress bar fills
- Status indicator pulses

**Feedback (50-150ms):**
- Immediate hover responses
- Touch feedback scaling
- Success confirmations
- Error shakes

### Performance Guidelines
- CSS animations preferred
- GPU-accelerated properties only
- Will-change used strategically
- RequestAnimationFrame for complex updates
