# ADR-001: Event-Driven Microservices Architecture

**Status:** Accepted  
**Date:** 2025-08-08  
**Deciders:** Lead Solutions Architect, Technical Lead, Product Owner  
**Technical Story:** Phase 2 Architecture Foundation  

## Context

The Basketball League Management Platform requires a scalable architecture that can handle 100x growth, support 1000+ concurrent users during tournaments, and provide real-time updates for live game scoring. The current monolithic Phase 1 architecture will not scale to meet these requirements.

### Key Requirements
- Support real-time game updates with <100ms latency
- Scale to handle tournament day traffic spikes (10x normal load)
- Enable independent deployment and scaling of different features
- Maintain system availability during partial failures
- Support multi-tenant architecture for different leagues

### Constraints
- Must maintain backward compatibility during migration
- Team has strong Node.js/TypeScript experience
- Limited budget for complex infrastructure initially
- Need to support offline-first mobile applications

## Decision

We will adopt an **Event-Driven Microservices Architecture** with the following characteristics:

### Architecture Patterns
1. **Microservices with Domain-Driven Design boundaries**
2. **Event Sourcing for game operations and audit requirements**
3. **CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation) for read/write optimization**
4. **Asynchronous messaging via AWS EventBridge and Kinesis**
5. **API Gateway pattern for client-facing APIs**

### Technology Stack
- **Backend Services**: Node.js + TypeScript (familiar to team)
- **Event Streaming**: AWS EventBridge + Kinesis Data Streams
- **Databases**: PostgreSQL (write models) + Redis (read models/cache)
- **API Gateway**: AWS API Gateway + Kong for advanced features
- **Container Orchestration**: Amazon EKS with Fargate
- **Service Mesh**: Istio for service-to-service communication

### Service Boundaries
- **Game Operations Service**: Real-time scoring and game state
- **League Management Service**: League setup and administration
- **User Management Service**: Authentication and profiles
- **Analytics Service**: Statistics and reporting
- **Notification Service**: Multi-channel communications
- **Payment Service**: Financial transactions

## Alternatives Considered

### Alternative 1: Monolithic Architecture (Status Quo)
**Pros:**
- Simpler deployment and debugging
- Easier data consistency management
- Lower initial complexity

**Cons:**
- Cannot scale individual components
- Single point of failure
- Difficult to support real-time requirements
- Technology coupling

**Rejected:** Does not meet scalability and real-time requirements.

### Alternative 2: Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA)
**Pros:**
- Better separation of concerns than monolith
- Some independent scaling capability
- Mature patterns and tooling

**Cons:**
- Still too tightly coupled for our needs
- Synchronous communication creates bottlenecks
- Limited real-time capabilities
- Shared database issues

**Rejected:** Insufficient isolation and scalability for tournament day loads.

### Alternative 3: Serverless-First Architecture
**Pros:**
- Ultimate scalability and cost optimization
- No infrastructure management
- Built-in availability

**Cons:**
- Cold start latency issues for real-time requirements
- Vendor lock-in concerns
- Complex debugging and monitoring
- Limited team experience

**Rejected:** Cold start latency incompatible with <100ms real-time requirements.

## Consequences

### Positive
- **Scalability**: Each service can scale independently based on demand
- **Resilience**: Partial failures don't bring down entire system
- **Technology Diversity**: Can choose optimal technology for each service
- **Real-time Capability**: Event-driven architecture enables sub-100ms updates
- **Development Velocity**: Teams can work independently on different services
- **Audit Trail**: Event sourcing provides complete audit trail for compliance

### Negative
- **Complexity**: Distributed system challenges (network partitions, eventual consistency)
- **Operational Overhead**: More services to monitor and maintain
- **Data Consistency**: Must handle eventual consistency carefully
- **Testing Complexity**: Integration testing across services is more complex
- **Initial Development Time**: Higher upfront architecture investment

### Mitigation Strategies

#### For Complexity
- Implement comprehensive observability (tracing, metrics, logging)
- Use service mesh for standardized communication patterns
- Establish clear service contracts and API versioning

#### For Data Consistency
- Use event sourcing for critical business transactions
- Implement saga patterns for distributed transactions
- Design for eventual consistency with conflict resolution

#### For Testing
- Implement contract testing with Pact
- Use service virtualization for integration tests
- Establish comprehensive end-to-end test suites

#### For Operational Overhead
- Implement Infrastructure as Code (Terraform)
- Use managed services where possible (RDS, ElastiCache, etc.)
- Establish automated deployment pipelines

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Foundation (Months 1-2)
1. Set up event streaming infrastructure (EventBridge + Kinesis)
2. Implement core services (User, League, Game Operations)
3. Establish service mesh and observability
4. Create CI/CD pipelines for microservices

### Phase 2: Migration (Months 3-4)
1. Gradually migrate functionality from monolith
2. Implement event sourcing for game operations
3. Set up CQRS read models for analytics
4. Establish monitoring and alerting

### Phase 3: Optimization (Months 5-6)
1. Performance tuning and scaling optimization
2. Advanced features (ML-powered scheduling, predictions)
3. Multi-tenant architecture completion
4. Disaster recovery implementation

## Success Metrics

- **Performance**: API response times <200ms (95th percentile)
- **Real-time**: Game updates delivered in <100ms
- **Scalability**: Handle 1000+ concurrent users without degradation
- **Reliability**: 99.9% uptime SLA achievement
- **Development Velocity**: Feature delivery time reduction by 40%

## Review Schedule

This ADR will be reviewed in 6 months (February 2026) to assess the effectiveness of the chosen architecture and make adjustments based on operational experience.
