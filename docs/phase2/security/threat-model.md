| **Repudiation** | Denying actions taken | Communication denial, payment disputes, policy violations |
| **Information Disclosure** | Exposing protected information | Minor PII exposure, financial data leaks, private communications |
| **Denial of Service** | Making system unavailable | Tournament day attacks, registration blocking, communication disruption |
| **Elevation of Privilege** | Gaining unauthorized access levels | Role escalation, admin privilege abuse, system compromise |

### 1.2 DREAD Scoring Methodology

**DREAD Risk Assessment Scale (1-10):**

| Factor | Low (1-3) | Medium (4-6) | High (7-10) |
|--------|-----------|--------------|-------------|
| **Damage Potential** | Minor inconvenience | Significant impact | Severe consequences |
| **Reproducibility** | Difficult to reproduce | Moderately reproducible | Easily reproducible |
| **Exploitability** | Requires expert knowledge | Requires some skill | Simple to exploit |

### 10.2 Detection Rules & Use Cases

#### High-Priority Detection Rules

1. **Multiple Failed Login Attempts**
   - **Threshold**: 5 failed attempts in 5 minutes
   - **Response**: Account lockout, admin notification
   - **Special Handling**: Parent account protection for minors

2. **Unusual Data Access Patterns**
   - **Detection**: Bulk data downloads, off-hours access
   - **Response**: User verification, data access logging
   - **Special Handling**: Minor PII access monitoring

3. **Suspicious Communication Patterns**
   - **Detection**: Private messaging to multiple minors
   - **Response**: SafeSport notification, communication review
   - **Special Handling**: Automated escalation for youth safety

4. **Privilege Escalation Attempts**
   - **Detection**: Role modification requests, unauthorized access attempts
   - **Response**: Administrative review, security team notification
   - **Special Handling**: Enhanced logging for compliance

### 10.3 Threat Hunting Procedures

#### Proactive Threat Hunting Schedule
- **Daily**: Automated IOC hunting, anomaly review
- **Weekly**: Behavioral pattern analysis, privilege audit
- **Monthly**: Comprehensive threat assessment, attack simulation
- **Quarterly**: Threat model updates, risk reassessment

#### Hunting Hypotheses
1. **Hypothesis**: Attackers are using compromised parent accounts to access multiple minor profiles
   - **Hunt**: Cross-reference account access patterns with family relationships
   - **Tools**: UEBA analytics, relationship mapping

2. **Hypothesis**: Malicious insiders are exfiltrating data during system maintenance windows
   - **Hunt**: Correlate maintenance schedules with data access anomalies
   - **Tools**: Database activity monitoring, file integrity monitoring

## Conclusion

This comprehensive threat model identifies and prioritizes the most critical security threats facing the Basketball League Management Platform, with particular emphasis on youth safety and regulatory compliance. The STRIDE/DREAD analysis reveals that data protection and service availability represent the highest risks, requiring immediate attention and substantial investment in security controls.

The specialized nature of youth sports platforms introduces unique threats related to child safety, requiring enhanced monitoring, specialized compliance measures, and robust incident response capabilities. Regular threat model updates and continuous monitoring are essential to adapt to evolving attack patterns and maintain the security posture necessary to protect young athletes and their families.
