## ADR-001: Microservices Architecture

**Status:** Accepted  
**Date:** January 8, 2025  
**Decision Makers:** Lead Architect, CTO, Development Team Lead  

### Context
The Basketball League Management Platform requires handling multiple distinct business domains (leagues, games, users, payments, statistics) with different scaling requirements and development velocities. The platform needs to support 50,000+ users with peak loads during tournament seasons.

### Decision
We will adopt a microservices architecture with services organized around business capabilities following Domain-Driven Design (DDD) principles.

### Consequences

**Positive:**
- Independent deployment and scaling of services
- Technology diversity where beneficial (e.g., Python for analytics)
- Fault isolation - failure in one service doesn't bring down the entire system
- Team autonomy - different teams can own different services
- Easier to understand and modify individual services
- Better alignment with business domains

**Negative:**
- Increased operational complexity
- Network latency between services
- Distributed system challenges (consistency, debugging)
- Need for service discovery and API gateway
- Higher infrastructure costs for small scale
- Need for sophisticated monitoring and tracing

### Alternatives Considered

1. **Monolithic Architecture**
   - Rejected: Would become unwieldy with 6+ distinct user types and complex business logic
   - Single point of failure for entire system
   - Difficult to scale specific features independently

2. **Serverless Architecture**
   - Rejected as primary architecture: Cold starts would impact real-time scoring
   - Adopted partially: Using Lambda for batch processing and scheduled tasks
   - Cost unpredictable at scale

3. **Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA)**
   - Rejected: Too heavyweight with ESB requirements
   - Microservices provides similar benefits with less overhead

### Implementation Details

Services will be:
- Containerized using Docker

   - Pricing model doesn't fit
   - Unnecessary complexity

### Implementation Details

Architecture:
- Socket.io server with Redis adapter
- Sticky sessions on load balancer
- Room-based channels per game
- Authentication via JWT tokens
- Automatic reconnection with exponential backoff
- Message queuing for offline clients

Event types:
```typescript
// Server to Client
'game:score:updated'
'game:period:ended'
'game:status:changed'
'player:fouled:out'

// Client to Server
'game:subscribe'
'game:unsubscribe'
'score:update' (scorekeepers only)
```

Scaling strategy:
- Redis pub/sub for cross-server communication
- Horizontal scaling with sticky sessions
