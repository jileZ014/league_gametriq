## Clean Code Principles Applied
- **Single Responsibility**: Each component has one clear purpose
- **DRY**: Reusable components and utility functions
- **Meaningful Names**: Clear, descriptive variable and function names
- **Small Functions**: Focused, testable units
- **Consistent Formatting**: Following project conventions

## SOLID Principles
- **S**: Each page component handles its specific feature
- **O**: Components are extensible through props
- **L**: Consistent interfaces for similar components
- **I**: Specific interfaces for different user needs
- **D**: Dependency on abstractions (interfaces) not concretions
