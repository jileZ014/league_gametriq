### Non-Critical Issues

1. **Moderate - Color picker keyboard navigation**
   - **Description**: Color picker in branding settings lacks full keyboard support
   - **Impact**: Minor accessibility limitation for keyboard-only users
   - **Workaround**: Text input available as alternative
   - **JIRA**: GT-2451

2. **Minor - Offline indicator z-index**
   - **Description**: Offline indicator occasionally appears behind modals

   - **Platform limitation**: Expected behavior on iOS
   - **JIRA**: GT-2453

## Performance Optimization Opportunities

Based on Lighthouse and performance testing:

1. **Remove unused JavaScript** - Potential 15KB savings
2. **Implement responsive images** - Potential 25KB savings
3. **Use next-gen image formats** (WebP/AVIF) - Potential 40KB savings
4. **Implement resource hints** (preconnect, prefetch)
5. **Consider HTTP/3** for additional performance gains

## Security Testing Summary
