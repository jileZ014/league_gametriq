# Stripe Live Mode Security Checklist

**Purpose:** Ensure secure transition from test mode to live payment processing  
**Last Updated:** 2025-08-10  
**Status:** PRE-PRODUCTION REVIEW REQUIRED

## Prerequisites

### ❌ Environment Configuration
- [ ] Separate environment variables for test/live Stripe keys
- [ ] Live keys stored in secure secret management system
- [ ] No Stripe keys in source code or version control
- [ ] Environment-specific configuration files

### ❌ Infrastructure Security
- [ ] HTTPS enforced on all payment pages
- [ ] Valid SSL certificate with strong cipher suites
- [ ] HSTS headers configured
- [ ] Secure hosting environment with PCI compliance

## Stripe Integration Security

### ❌ API Key Management
- [ ] Live publishable key only exposed to frontend
- [ ] Live secret key only on secure backend
- [ ] Key rotation procedure documented
- [ ] Access logging for key usage

### ❌ Webhook Security
```typescript
// Required implementation
import Stripe from 'stripe';

export async function verifyWebhookSignature(
  payload: string,
  signature: string,
  endpointSecret: string
): Promise<Stripe.Event> {
  const stripe = new Stripe(process.env.STRIPE_SECRET_KEY!, {
    apiVersion: '2023-10-16',
  });
  
  try {
    return stripe.webhooks.constructEvent(
      payload,
      signature,
      endpointSecret
    );
  } catch (error) {
    throw new Error('Invalid webhook signature');
  }
}
```

- [ ] Webhook endpoint using HTTPS
- [ ] Webhook signature verification implemented
- [ ] Webhook endpoint secret stored securely
- [ ] Idempotency handling for webhook events
- [ ] Webhook event logging
- [ ] Rate limiting on webhook endpoint

### ❌ Payment Intent Security
- [ ] Server-side payment intent creation only
- [ ] Amount validation before payment intent creation
- [ ] Metadata includes user/session identifiers
- [ ] Payment confirmation on server-side
- [ ] Double-charge prevention logic

### ❌ Customer Data Protection
- [ ] No credit card data stored locally
- [ ] PCI DSS compliance attestation
- [ ] Customer data encrypted in transit
- [ ] Secure token handling
- [ ] No card details in logs

## Code Security Review

### ❌ Frontend Security
```typescript
// Secure implementation pattern
const stripe = loadStripe(process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY!);

// Never expose secret keys
// Never handle raw card data
// Always use Stripe Elements
```

- [ ] Only publishable key in frontend code
- [ ] Stripe.js loaded from Stripe's servers
- [ ] Content Security Policy allows Stripe
- [ ] No inline scripts for payment handling
- [ ] Input validation before API calls

### ❌ Backend Security
```typescript
// Required validations
export async function createPaymentIntent(amount: number, userId: string) {
  // Validate amount
  if (amount < 100 || amount > 1000000) {
    throw new Error('Invalid amount');
  }
  
  // Validate user authorization
  if (!await isUserAuthorized(userId)) {
    throw new Error('Unauthorized');
  }
  
  // Log for audit trail
  await logPaymentAttempt(userId, amount);
  
  // Create intent with metadata
  return stripe.paymentIntents.create({
    amount,
    currency: 'usd',
    metadata: {
      userId,
      timestamp: Date.now().toString(),
    },
  });
}
```

- [ ] Amount validation and limits

- [ ] Security test cases
- [ ] Load testing completed

## Compliance Requirements

### ❌ PCI DSS Compliance
- [ ] SAQ-A or SAQ-A-EP completed
- [ ] No local card data storage
- [ ] Secure network architecture
- [ ] Access control measures
- [ ] Regular security testing

### ❌ Data Protection

## Monitoring and Alerts

### ❌ Real-time Monitoring

  highAmount: 100000,       // Alert for payments over $1000
  velocityLimit: 10,        // Alert for >10 payments from same user/hour
  webhookFailures: 3,       // Alert after 3 webhook failures
};
```

- [ ] Payment failure monitoring
