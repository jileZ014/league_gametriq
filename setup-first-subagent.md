# Setting Up Your First Sub-Agent in Claude Code

## Step-by-Step Guide

### 1. Open Claude Code Terminal
Open your terminal where Claude Code is installed.

### 2. Use the /agents Command
Type `/agents` in Claude Code to open the agent management interface.

### 3. Choose "Create New Agent"
From the menu, select the option to create a new agent.

### 4. Configure Your First Agent

#### Example: Python Test Writer Agent

Here's a simple starter agent configuration:

```yaml
---
name: test-writer
description: Python test writer specialist. PROACTIVELY writes unit tests for Python code.
tools: Read, Write, Edit, Grep, Glob, Bash
---
You are an expert Python test writer. Your job is to:
1. Analyze Python code and identify what needs testing
2. Write comprehensive unit tests using pytest
3. Follow existing test patterns in the codebase
4. Ensure good test coverage for edge cases
```

### 5. Save the Agent Configuration

The agent will be saved to either:
- Project level: `.claude/agents/test-writer.md`
- Global level: `~/.claude/agents/test-writer.md`

### 6. Using Your Sub-Agent

Once created, Claude Code will automatically delegate to your sub-agent when:
- You ask for test writing tasks
- The task matches the agent's expertise

You can also explicitly call the agent:
```
"Use the test-writer agent to create tests for the auth module"
```

## Alternative: Manual Creation

### 1. Create the Directory
```bash
# For project-level agent
mkdir -p .claude/agents

# For global agent
mkdir -p ~/.claude/agents
```

### 2. Create the Agent File
```bash
# Project level
touch .claude/agents/test-writer.md

# Global level
touch ~/.claude/agents/test-writer.md
```

### 3. Add Configuration
Open the file and add the YAML frontmatter and instructions.

## Tips for Success

1. **Use Action Words**: Include "PROACTIVELY" or "MUST BE USED" in descriptions
2. **Be Specific**: Clear, focused agents work better than general ones
3. **Grant Appropriate Tools**: Only give tools the agent actually needs
4. **Test Your Agent**: Try simple tasks first to ensure it works as expected
5. **Iterate**: Refine the agent's instructions based on performance

## Testing Your First Agent

After creating your agent:

1. Start a new Claude Code session
2. Give it a task that matches your agent's expertise
3. Watch Claude Code delegate to your sub-agent
4. Review the results and refine as needed

## Example Commands to Try

```bash
# After creating a test-writer agent
"Write tests for the user authentication module"

# After creating a code-reviewer agent
"Review the recent changes in main.py"

# After creating a doc-writer agent
"Document the API endpoints in routes.py"
```

## Next Steps

1. Create your first agent using `/agents`
2. Test it with a simple task
3. Create more specialized agents as needed
4. Share useful agents with your team via version control
